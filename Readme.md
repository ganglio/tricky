# Tricky Words Flash Card Game

This project is a simple (very) tricky words flash card game written during the lock down COVID-19 period.

You do have to waste your time someway and my little one was in reception at the time so, why not?

## Build & run locally

To build and run the application just use the following command:

```bash
$ go build &&
  APP_ENV=dev \
  PORT=:3000 \
  ./tricky
```

## Word source

The words have been extracted from the [Jolly Learning - Handy Tricky Word List](https://www.jollylearning.co.uk/resource-bank/handy-tricky-word-list/).
